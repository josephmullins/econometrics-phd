----- Lectures ------
- define identification
- linear IV
- generalized roy model with two examples to show credible inference
- MTE and LATE and monotonicity?
- Marschak's maxim with examples
- 3 prototype models (describe estimation? identification?)
- Extremum Estimators:
    - Introduce MLE estimator of search model
    - Introduce MLE estimator of probit model
    - Introduce general setup.
    - What are properties?
    - from here, follow the slides (maybe skipping proofs)
    - At minimum distance: introduce the savings model (segue into simulation) **
- Simulation (follow slides but skip the example model there)
    - how to calculate a moment for the savings model? Could be tricky! (motivate integration by simulation) **
    - how to get standard errors from two stage estimator? (motivate bootstrap)
    - simulated integrals and estimators
    - bootstrap
    - For MSL, use joint distribution of wages and assets? Or joint sequences? Would have to work this out. **
    - Indirect inference (use quantiles as simple example. Pull in entry exit too maybe?) **
- Panel Data / Unobserved Heterogeneity
    - Example: separating volatility from true risk in income process. **
    - Heterogeneity in income risk? How to deal with this? **
    - Review fixed vs random effects (clustering and standard errors)
    - Review the Athey and Imbens paper on clustering? **
    - Use simple diff in diff to illustrate clustering issues.
    - Discuss: how does unobserved heterogeneity upset our estimators? In terms of initial conditions and state variables. **
    - Exercise: duration dependence in our CPS data. **
    - Show inconsistency of panel data estimators (just the one example with lagged dependent variable)
- Discrete Choice + Dynamic Discrete Choice
    - Follow notes almost as is. 
    - Everything looks useful. Could we improve control function example? **
    - Use GMM when you have endogenous regressors, or do control function approach (example given) ** work out nonparametric approach? would be a good example of nonparametric identification.
    - Demand model? Go back to unobserved heterogeneity to think about the issue with prices. ***
    - Repeat selection problem (when Z enters the outcome equation but is endogenous, still selected!) ***
    - Then Dynamic Discrete Choice with whatever time left.

2. Data setup for search model and code log-likelihood.
3. Estimation of search model and code standard errors.
3. SMM est of search model. Or min distance?
4. MLE est of entry exit model? Or we could try matching transition probabilities? |X| x 2 x 2 vector?

6. Est income process. 
7. SMM est of savings model.

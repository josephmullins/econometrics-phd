----- Lectures ------
- define identification
- linear IV
- generalized roy model with two examples to show credible inference
- MTE and LATE and monotonicity?
- Marschak's maxim with examples
- 3 prototype models (describe estimation? identification?)
- Extremum Estimators:
    - Introduce MLE estimator of search model
    - Introduce MLE estimator of probit model
    - Introduce general setup.
    - What are properties?
    - from here, follow the slides (maybe skipping proofs)
    - At minimum distance: introduce the savings model (segue into simulation) **
- Simulation (follow slides but skip the example model there)
    - how to calculate a moment for the savings model? Could be tricky! (motivate integration by simulation) **
    - how to get standard errors from two stage estimator? (motivate bootstrap)
    - simulated integrals and estimators
    - bootstrap
    - For MSL, use joint distribution of wages and assets? Or joint sequences? Would have to work this out. **
    - Indirect inference (use quantiles as simple example. Pull in entry exit too maybe?) **
- Panel Data / Unobserved Heterogeneity
    - Example: separating volatility from true risk in income process. **
    - Heterogeneity in income risk? How to deal with this? **
    - Review fixed vs random effects (clustering and standard errors)
    - Review the Athey and Imbens paper on clustering? **
    - Use simple diff in diff to illustrate clustering issues.
    - Discuss: how does unobserved heterogeneity upset our estimators? In terms of initial conditions and state variables. **
    - Exercise: duration dependence in our CPS data. **
    - Show inconsistency of panel data estimators (just the one example with lagged dependent variable)
- Discrete Choice + Dynamic Discrete Choice
    - Follow notes almost as is. 
    - Everything looks useful. Could we improve control function example? **
    - Use GMM when you have endogenous regressors, or do control function approach (example given) ** work out nonparametric approach? would be a good example of nonparametric identification.
    - Demand model? Go back to unobserved heterogeneity to think about the issue with prices. ***
    - Repeat selection problem (when Z enters the outcome equation but is endogenous, still selected!) ***
    - Then Dynamic Discrete Choice with whatever time left.


----- Problem Sets Brainstorm -----

1. Credible inference problem.
2. Data setup for search model and code log-likelihood.
3. Estimation of search model and code standard errors.
4. Minimum distance estimation of income processes.
    - do it with and without a fixed effect
    - how to estimate model with a fixed effect?

5. SMM estimation of lifecycle model (w/ model fit)
6. 
4. MLE est of entry exit model? Or we could try matching transition probabilities? |X| x 2 x 2 vector?
5. SMM est of entry exit model.
6. Est income process. 
7. SMM est of savings model.

--- List
R1: numerical maximization
R2: search model and entry/exit model solution (?) (+ intro to search data? or likelihood for search model?) 
R3: A warning for using auto differentiation + std errors for maximum likelihood + integration?
R4: Minimum distance estimation of income processes
R5: Code to simulate
R6: 


# - for lifecycle savings, we need to:

(1) solve model #<- in tutorial
(2) simulate data from the model #<- s
(3) estimate the income process (minimum distance routine or other)
(4) evaluate model fit
(5) bootstrap standard errors (or otherwise)

# idea:
A4: estimate income process with exta covariance term or fixed effect + bootstrap + weighting?
R4: min distance + simulate data from model? (go through tutorial) 

A5: estimate model
R5: simulate data from model

# idea:
# R4: go through notes on model and simulation of income process. introduce data?
# A4: write code to simulate data and calculate moments?

    "text": "Topics\n\nIdentification, Credible Inference, and Marschak’s Maxim\nWe formally define identification and discuss (via examples) what people really mean when they talk about identification and credible inference. We use the Generalized Roy Model to compare identification via functional form to nonparametric identification.\nWe introduce Marschak’s Maxim as a guide for doing empirical model-based research.\n\nReading\nThe two survey articles by Keane (2010) (link) and Angrist and Pischke (2010) (link) - although aging - provide two important perspectives on the issues of credible inference in economics. Low and Meghir (2017) provide a nice review of the advantages of the structural approach.\nThe original paper by Marschak (1953) may be of interest. Heckman and Vytlacil (2007) provide a nice discussion of Marschak’s Maxim in the context of policy evaluation. They introduce (Heckman and Vytlacil 2005; Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil 2011) the Marginal Treatment Effect as a tool for thinking about quasi-experimental estimators and policy evaluation.\n\n\n\nExtremum Estimators\nWe introduce the concept of an extremum estimator and discuss conditions under which this estimator has good asymptotic properties, with specific applications to maximum likelihood, minimum distance, and generalized method of moments estimators. We discuss optimal weighting of the relative efficiency properties of these estimators.\n\nReading\nThis section relies heavily on the Newey and McFadden (1994) chapter of the Handbook of Econometrics. Although not necessary, Hayashi (2011) provides a very thorough treatment of all of these estimators.\n\n\n\nSimulation Methods\nWe introduce simulation methods for the estimation of structural models, including the Simulated Method of Moments, Indirect Inference, and the Bootstrap method for inference.\n\nReading\nYou may find the Horowitz (2001) handbook chapter useful. Cameron and Trivedi (2005) provide a useful discussion of simulation-based estimators in their textbook.\n\n\n\nPanel Data Methods\nWe talk about individual heterogeneity and discuss the use of panel data for detecting individual heterogeneity in data.\n\n\nDiscrete Choice and Dynamic Discrete Choice\nWe review some of the formalities of discrete choice models and consider estimation of these models in the presence of dynamics."

    "text": "We are going to work through an example of “identification via functional form” that we will see in class. The model looks as follows:\n\\[ Y = X\\beta + \\alpha D + \\epsilon - \\varphi\\nu \\]\nand\n\\[ D = \\mathbf{1}\\{X\\beta - \\nu \\geq 0\\} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\nu\\) are independent with \\(\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\\) and \\(\\nu\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\). This is equivalent to writing:\n\\[ Y = X\\beta + \\alpha D + \\xi \\]\nwith\n\\[ \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\xi \\\\ \\nu \\end{array}\\right] \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0,\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon} + \\varphi^2 & -\\varphi \\\\ -\\varphi & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\right).\\]\nLet’s start by writing some code to simulate data from this simple selection model:\n\nusing Random, Distributions\n\nfunction sim_data(X ; β,γ,α,φ,σ_ϵ)\n    N = size(X,1)\n    ν = rand(Normal(),N)\n    ϵ = σ_ϵ * rand(Normal(),N)\n    D = (X * γ .- ν) .&gt; 0\n    Y = X * β .+ α * D .+ ϵ .- φ*ν\n    return Y, D\nend\n\nsim_data (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nLet’s quickly test this function by selecting some default parameters.\n\nN = 1000\nX = [ones(N) 2*rand(Normal(),N)]\nβ = [0., 1.]\nγ = [0.1, 0.5]\nφ = 1.\nα = 0.6\nσ_ϵ = 0.5\n\nY, D = sim_data(X ; β,γ,α,φ,σ_ϵ)\n\n([1.132860301951354, -3.6466921358145283, -2.7966645365786507, 1.074252425709782, 5.251260632435156, 5.333302836895356, 1.048140172519132, -0.012316247760416288, 1.0187652704332761, 3.398234585007554  …  3.1520102965904524, 6.306622263324812, 3.810961616754668, 0.6280107123658936, 0.23612972322392936, -0.735663499435032, 3.6357910280620107, 1.5955063606600457, 2.4628872110429034, 1.1654458069287195], Bool[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1  …  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n\n\nTo start, let’s think about estimating the parameters \\(\\gamma\\) using maximum likelihood. We will establish the properties of this estimator in class. Here let’s just focus on numerically how to attack the minimization problem. The log-likelihood of the data D given X is:\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}(\\gamma) = \\sum_{n}l(D_{n}; X_{n},\\gamma) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N}D_{n}\\log(\\Phi(X\\gamma)) + (1-D_{n})\\log(1-\\Phi(X\\gamma)) \\]\nLet’s write up this likelihood function.\n\nfunction log_likelihood(D,X,γ)\n    ll = 0.\n    for n in eachindex(D)\n        xg = X[n,1] * γ[1] + X[n,2] * γ[2] \n        if D[n]\n            ll += log(cdf(Normal(),xg))\n        else\n            ll += log(1-cdf(Normal(),xg))\n        end\n    end\n    return ll\nend\nlog_likelihood(D,X,[0.,0.])\n\n-693.1471805599322\n\n\nA necessary condition for the maximum likelihood estimator is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\gamma} = \\sum_{n}s_{n}(\\hat{\\gamma}) = 0\\]\nwhere\n\\[s_{n}(\\gamma) = \\frac{\\partial l(D_{n} ; X_{n},\\gamma)}{\\partial \\gamma} \\]\nis often referred to as the “score” of the likelihood.\n\n\nOptimization is most efficient when we have access to the first and second order derivatives of the function. There is a general class of hill-climbing (or descent in the case of minimization) algorithms that find new guesses \\(\\gamma_{k+1}\\) given \\(\\gamma_{k}\\) as:\n\\[ \\gamma_{k+1} = \\gamma_{k} + \\lambda_{k}A_{k}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial \\gamma} \\]\nwhere \\(Q\\) is the function being maximized (or minimized). \\(A_{k}\\) defines a direction in which to search (providing weights on the derivatives) and \\(\\lambda_{k}\\) is a scalar variable known as a step-size which is often calculated optimally in each iteration \\(k\\). For Newton’s method, the matrix \\(A_{k}\\) is the inverse of the Hessian of the objective function \\(Q\\). Since the hessian can sometimes be expensive to calculate, other methods use approximations to the Hessian that are cheaper to compute.\nSince we have a simple model, we can calculate derivatives relatively easily. However julia and many other languages now provide packages for Automatic Differentiation, which essentially trace all of the operations inside the function and implement the chain rule. It is very quick! Below we’ll compare a hard-coded derivative to this automatic differentiation.\n\nusing ForwardDiff\n\nfunction deriv_ll(D,X,γ)\n    dll = zeros(2)\n    for n in eachindex(D)\n        xg = X[n,1] * γ[1] + X[n,2] * γ[2] \n        if D[n]\n            dl = pdf(Normal(),xg) / cdf(Normal(),xg)\n        else\n            dl = - pdf(Normal(),xg) / (1 - cdf(Normal(),xg))\n        end\n        dll[1] += X[n,1] * dl\n        dll[2] += X[n,2] * dl            \n    end\n    return dll\nend\n\nauto_deriv_ll(D,X,γ) = ForwardDiff.gradient(x-&gt;log_likelihood(D,X,x),γ)\n\nd1 = deriv_ll(D,X,γ)\nd2 = auto_deriv_ll(D,X,γ)\n[d1 d2]\n\n2×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n -31.4069  -31.4069\n -29.5423  -29.5423\n\n\nOk so we’re confident that these functions work as intended, but how do they compare in performance?\n\n@time deriv_ll(D,X,γ);\n@time auto_deriv_ll(D,X,γ);\n\n  0.000028 seconds (1 allocation: 80 bytes)\n  0.000043 seconds (6 allocations: 352 bytes)\n\n\nBoth are quite quick but you can see that we’re not losing much with automatic differentiation. In my experience, the gap between the two methods can narrow for more complicated functions.\n\n\n\nSo now let’s try implementing the maximum likelihood estimator using two different gradient-based algorithms: Newton’s Method (which uses the Hessian), and the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm (which updates search direction using chanegs in the first derivative). For maximum likelihood there is also the Berndt–Hall–Hall–Hausman (BHHH) algorithm which uses the following equality that we will derive in class:\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}[\\nabla{\\gamma'}s(\\gamma)] = -\\mathbb{E}[s(\\gamma)s(\\gamma)'] \\]\nThis formula states that the hessian of the log-likelihood is equal to the negative covariance of the score. This is a method that only works when maximizing the log-likelihood. Unfortunately Optim does not provide an implementation of BHHH but it is worth knowing about.\nWhile Newton’s method requires calculation of the Hessian (second derivatives), BFGS and related methods only require first derivatives. Typically, this makes each iteration quicker but will take more time to converge. Let’s test them.\n\nusing Optim\nmin_objective(x) = -log_likelihood(D,X,x) #&lt;- Optim assumes that we will minimize a function, hence the negative\nγ_guess = zeros(2)\nprintln(\" ---- Using Newton's Method ------ \")\nres1 = optimize(min_objective,γ_guess,Newton(),autodiff=:forward,Optim.Options(show_trace=true))\nprintln(\" ---- Using BFGS ------ \")\nres2 = optimize(min_objective,γ_guess,BFGS(),autodiff=:forward,Optim.Options(show_trace=true))\n[res1.minimizer res2.minimizer γ]\n\n ---- Using Newton's Method ------ \nIter     Function value   Gradient norm \n     0     6.931472e+02     9.072234e+02\n * time: 4.696846008300781e-5\n     1     5.170501e+02     1.388497e+02\n * time: 0.0003650188446044922\n     2     5.074227e+02     2.790597e+00\n * time: 0.0006308555603027344\n     3     5.074194e+02     1.179917e-04\n * time: 0.0008649826049804688\n     4     5.074194e+02     9.096168e-12\n * time: 0.0010650157928466797\n ---- Using BFGS ------ \nIter     Function value   Gradient norm \n     0     6.931472e+02     9.072234e+02\n * time: 7.295608520507812e-5\n     1     5.238897e+02     1.767467e+02\n * time: 0.00039386749267578125\n     2     5.236553e+02     1.761320e+02\n * time: 0.0006258487701416016\n     3     5.076641e+02     2.366312e+01\n * time: 0.0008478164672851562\n     4     5.074194e+02     7.988743e-02\n * time: 0.0010349750518798828\n     5     5.074194e+02     4.225729e-03\n * time: 0.0012378692626953125\n     6     5.074194e+02     7.219726e-08\n * time: 0.0014328956604003906\n     7     5.074194e+02     2.127742e-13\n * time: 0.0016629695892333984\n\n\n2×3 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.0335542  0.0335542  0.1\n 0.472962   0.472962   0.5\n\n\n\n\n\nIn class we will see that\n\\[ \\mathbb{E}[Y|X,D] = X\\beta + \\alpha D - \\varphi\\left[(1-D)\\frac{\\phi(X\\gamma)}{1-\\Phi(X\\gamma)} - D\\frac{\\phi(X\\gamma)}{\\Phi(X\\gamma)}\\right] \\]\nwhich allows \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) to be estimated by virtue of a functional form assumption on the distribution of unobservables.

We let \\(j\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) index this decision to enter or not. Let \\(j(f,m,t)\\) indicate the choice of firm \\(f\\) in market \\(m\\) in period \\(t\\).\nWe let \\(a_{f,m,t}=j(f,m,t-1)\\) indicate whether firm \\(f\\) is active in market \\(m\\) in period \\(t\\), which means they entered in the previous period.\nLet \\(x_{m}\\) be a market-level unobservable that shifts the profitability of operations in market \\(m\\).\nIn addition to the observed states, each firm draws a pair of idiosyncatic shocks to payoffs in each period, \\(\\epsilon_{f}=[\\epsilon_{f0},\\epsilon_{f1}]\\) that is private information to the firm and is iid over markets, firms, and time periods.\nFirms make their decisions in each period simultaneously\n\nTo simplify notation, suppress dependance of outcomes on the market \\(m\\) and time period \\(t\\). Because we are writing a symmetric model, we will also suppress dependence on \\(f\\). The deterministic component of the payoff to entering is a function of the market primitives (\\(x\\)), the firm’s activity status (\\(a\\)), and the other firm’s entry decision \\(j^\\prime\\):\n\\[ u_{1}(x,a,j^{\\prime}) = \\phi_{0} + \\phi_{1}x - \\phi_{2}j^\\prime - \\phi_{3}(1-a) \\]\nThe payoff to not entering is simply:\n\\[{u}_{0}(x,a) = \\phi_{4}a \\]\nBefore characterizing the solution to the firm’s problem, let’s code up these payoff functions:\n\n\nu1(x,a,j′,ϕ) = ϕ[1] + ϕ[2]*x - ϕ[3]j′ + ϕ[4]*(1-a)\nu0(a,ϕ) = a * ϕ[5]\n\nu0 (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(j^*(x,a,a',\\epsilon)\\) be the firm’s optimal decision given the state and the idiosyncratic shock. We will focus on symmetric equilibria so this policy function is sufficient to describe the behavior of both firms.\nThe value to either firm of arriving in a period with state \\((x,a,a')\\) can be written recursively as:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nV(x,a,a') = \\mathbb{E}_{\\epsilon,\\epsilon'}\\max\\{u_{1}(x,a,j^*(x,a,a',\\epsilon'))+\\epsilon_{1} + \\beta V(x,1,j^*(x,a,a',\\epsilon')), \\\\ u_{0}(x,a) + \\epsilon_{0} + \\beta V(x,0,j^*(x,a,a',\\epsilon'))\\}\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nDefine the optimal choice probability in equilibrium as:\n\\[ p(x,a,a') = \\int_{\\epsilon}j^*(x,a,a',\\epsilon)dF(\\epsilon) \\]\nWith this in hand we can integrate out the other firm’s shocks \\(\\epsilon\\)’ to get:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nV(x,a,a') = \\mathbb{E}_{\\epsilon}\\max\\{\\phi_{0}+\\phi_{1}x - \\phi_{2}p(x,a',a) +\\epsilon_{1} + \\beta [p(x,a',a)V(x,1,1) + (1-p(x,a',a))V(x,1,0)], \\\\\na \\phi_{4} + \\epsilon_{0} + \\beta [p(x,a',a)V(x,0,1) + (1-p(x,a',a))V(x,0,0)]\\}\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nDefine the choice-specific values as:\n\\[ v_{1}(x,a,a') = \\phi_{0}+\\phi_{1}x - \\phi_{2}p(x,a',a) + \\beta [p(x,a',a)V(x,1,1) + (1-p(x,a',a))V(x,1,0)] \\]\nand\n\\[ v_{0}(x,a,a') = a \\phi_{4} + \\beta [p(x,a',a)V(x,0,1) + (1-p(x,a',a))V(x,0,0)] \\]\nSo assuming that \\(\\epsilon\\) is distributed as type I extreme value random variable with location parameter 0 and scale parameter 1 we get analytical expressions for the choice probabilities and the expected value of the maximum:\n\\[ V(x) = \\gamma + \\log\\left(\\exp(v_{0}(x,a,a'))+\\exp(v_{1}(x,a,a'))\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and\n\\[ p(x,a,a') = \\frac{\\exp(v_{1}(x,a,a'))}{\\exp(v_{0}(x,a,a'))+\\exp(v_{1}(x,a,a'))} \\]\nBefore we define equilibrium and think about solving the model, let’s quickly write up the mapping between the other firm’s choice probabilities and the choice values:\n\n# Fixing x, assume that V is stored as a 2 x 2 array\n# The argument p is the current guess of p(x,a',a)\nfunction choice_values(x,a,p,V,ϕ,β)\n    v0 = u0(a,ϕ) + β * p * V[1,2] + β * (1-p) * V[1,1]\n    v1 = u1(x,a,p,ϕ) + β * p * V[2,2] + β * (1-p) * V[2,1]\n    return v0,v1\nend\n\nchoice_values (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nIn principle we could iterate on this mapping to find (for a fixed \\(p\\)), the firm’s optimal solution. But that won’t be an efficient way to try and solve for the equilibrium.\n\n\n\nThe solution concept for this model is Markov Perfect Equilibrium.

Here is a quick snippet of code to see how many observations we have on average per person:\n\n@chain data begin\n    groupby(:CPSIDP)\n    @combine :T = length(:EMPSTAT)\n    @combine :average = mean(:T) :frac_panel = mean(:T.&gt;1)\nend\n\n1×2 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\naverage\nfrac_panel\n\n\n\nFloat64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\n1.83191\n0.582806\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we see that more than half of the individuals in this sample can be found in more than one month of the data.\nThe @chain macro comes from the package DataFramesMeta and is a convenient syntax for composing operations into one block. For example:\n\n@chain x begin\n    func1(y1)\n    func2(y2)\n    func3(y3)\nend\n\nis equivalent to\n\nfunc3(func2(func1(x,y1),y2),y3)\n\n\n\nCalculating some moments\nYou may find the codebook useful for understanding particular variables. We have already limited the data to individuals who are working (EMPSTAT=10), have a job but did not work last week (EMPSTAT==12), or are unemployed (EMPSTAT==21).\nSuppose we wanted to use the panel dimension to measure transition rates.

    "text": "Consider the following extension of the undirected search model. Let \\(X_{n}\\) be a vector of demographics for person \\(n\\):\n\\[ X_{n} = [1,\\ C_{n},\\ F_{n},\\ R_{n}] \\]\nwhere \\(C_{n}\\) is a dummy variable that indicates if an individual has a college degree, \\(F_{n}\\) is a dummy variable indicating that an individual is female, and \\(R_{n}\\) is a dummy that indicates if person \\(n\\) reports their race as not “white”. Define a new set of parameters that depend on these observables:\n\nThe flow value of unemployment is \\(b(X) = X\\beta_{b}\\)\nThe probability of job destruction is \\[ \\delta(X) = \\frac{\\exp(X\\gamma_{\\delta})}{1+\\exp(X\\gamma_{\\delta})} \\]\nThe probability of a job offer is \\[ \\lambda(X) = \\frac{\\exp(X\\gamma_{\\lambda})}{1+\\exp(X\\gamma_{\\lambda})} \\]\n\\(\\beta\\) takes a value of 0.995.\nWage offers are drawn from a log normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu(X) = X\\gamma_{\\mu}\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma(X) = \\exp(X\\gamma_{\\sigma})\\)\nLog wages are observed with measurement error: \\[ \\log(W^{o}_{n}) = \\log(W_{n}) + \\zeta_{n} \\] where \\(\\zeta_{n}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_{\\zeta})\\).\n\nSo the parameters of the model are:\n\\[ \\theta = (\\gamma_{b},\\gamma_{\\delta},\\gamma_{\\lambda},\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\sigma},\\sigma^2_{\\zeta}) \\]\nWe are going to estimate this model on CPS data.

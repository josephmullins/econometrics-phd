    "In class we discuss the solution and identification of this simple model of undirected search. Time is discrete and indexed by $t$ over an infinite horizon. Workers move between employment and unemployment, have linear utility and cannot save. Let us review the parameters of the model:\n",

    "| --------- | ------------|\n",
    "| $\\lambda$ | The probability an unemployed worker receives a job offer | \n",
    "| $\\delta$  | The probability an employed worker loses their job | \n",
    "| $F_{W}$   | The distribution of wage offers | \n",
    "| $1-\\beta$   | The exponential rate of discounting | \n",
    "| $b$       | Per-period utility when unemployed | \n",

    "In class we showed that the optimal decision rule of the worker is characterized by a reservation wage. We derived the reservation wage equation:\n",

    "$$ w^* = b + \\beta\\lambda\\int_{w^*}\\frac{1-F_{W}(w)}{1 + \\beta(1-\\delta)}dw $$\n",

    "and we characterized the steady state rate of unemployment as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P[E = 0] = \\frac{h}{h+\\delta} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h = \\lambda(1-F_{W}(w^*))$ is the rate at which workers exit unemployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we should that the steady state fraction of unemployment durations $t$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P[t_{U}=t] = h(1-h)^{t} $$\n",
